#matplotlib=3.7.1
#numpy~=1.24.3
#opencv-python~=4.7.0.72
#Pillow~=9.5.0

# ^^ Development environment, as of June 2023, Linux Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 11,
#  macOS 13.4
# Note that matplotlib, and it's dependency Pillow, are needed only with
#  the 'equalize_it.py' module.

# Note that for PyCharm 2023, to get opencv documentation working, the interpreter
#  needs to use opencv-python 4.5.5.64 or possibly 4.6. Ver 4.7+ doesn't do
#  documentation for opencv.
